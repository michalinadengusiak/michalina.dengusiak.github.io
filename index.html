  <p class="w3-center"><em>I love programming!</em></p>
  <p>Hi! My name is Michalina. I am currently 11 years old and go to grade 7. In my short life, I have already accomplished quite a sum of things. </p>
  
	<button class="collapsible"><i>click to find out more...</i></button>

<div class= "content">
	<p>
		My father is a computational engineer, so I was exposed to computers at a  <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/2019-11-17_FirstComputer.png"><font color = "#FF7F50">very young age</font></a>.
		It all started out when I was 4 years old. 
		My father was at the Forum just looking if any new updates were happening in the world. 
		Then, I saw the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/update-happy-yalda?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1341141&groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987"><font color = "#FF7F50">Honeybee icon </font></a> and I asked: “What is that?”
		My father answered that it is the Honeybee icon and I replied: “Bees aren’t yellow!”
		This made an idea sprout in my father’s mind so he wrote a message to <a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari"><font color = "#FF7F50">Mostapha</font></a> saying that bees aren’t yellow, afterwards together we created a color scheme of what colors bees could be. 
		I was so pleased to see the icons that adjusted to the new colours. This is the story of how the Honeybee icon became brownish, orangish and not yellow...
		</br>
		</br>
		Before that happened, I already had spent time with <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/GraftingEggsQueenBee.JPG"><font color = "#FF7F50">bees</font></a> since my father was a beekeeper; before becoming an engineer. 
		So I marked the queen bees and thus providing some experience with bees.
		In addition, I would always got to a apiary for the holidays and would watch them work and "rescue" them from the lake.
		My favorite time with bees is eating the honey and making of the wax candles.
		</br>
		</br>
		Moreover, at that time in my father’s office there was a commotion going on about how <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/2019-11-17_Revit.png"><font color = "#FF7F50">Revit</font> </a>and BIM are not for Germany and that you should use AutoCAD instead. People said that Revit is too hard, and that AutoCAD is just better. 
		So, he asked me if I wanted to build the house of my dreams and furnish it. 
		I was dumbstruck and agreed at once. 
		Over the weekend, I built and furnished my dream house with a little help from my father. 
		When, my father came back to his office on Monday he made a presentation and said: “You can do it, if my 4-year-old daughter can”. From that moment onwards Revit started being used.
		</br>
		</br>
		When I was 5 years old, an architect did a workshop in our Kindergarten about designing houses and we were supposed to make our own one house out of <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/PrototypeFirstModel.JPG"><font color = "#FF7F50">cardboard</font></a>. 
		I did what he wanted and made my own house. As I went home,my father saw my work. 
		He asked if I want to see how different animals around the world would feel in my house. 
		Initially I did not fully understand but agreed anyways. 
		He used Ladybug Tools on <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/MichalinaDengusiak"><font color = "#FF7F50">Grasshopper</font> </a>to explain to me the sun position and together we did a sun path analysis on my prototype. 
		We drew models in Rhino and looked at the different climates.
		</br>
		</br>
		I found this very interesting and had a lot of fun. My father noticed that I was interested, so he thought that maybe I should try programming. 
		That's how I started out with <a target = "_blank" href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/"><font color = "#FF7F50">Scratch</font></a>, a program that seemed like a game to me. 
		I would spend a lot of time working on new games, and, without my knowledge getting a head start into the computational world. 
		Soon, I found out about <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.python.org/"><font color = "#FF7F50">Python</a></font>, a basic yet fun program. 
		It grabbed my attention immediately since it was easy, yet it gave you lots of possibilities.
		So, I completed a course on <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/cert-1073-10595912.jpg"><font color = "#FF7F50">Sololearn</font></a> to deepen my knowledge about it.
		That was a huge accomplishment since now I can do some things on Python. 
		</br>
		</br>
		Afterwards, my father and <a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/theo-armour"><font color = "#FF7F50">Theo</font></a> were working on Ladybug Tools Spider gbXML Viewer, and I helped them.In a way in which, I did the user guide videos and the recording for that.
		</br>
		</br>
		My father showed me the GitHub desktop app and Git Bash- since, at that time, he was doing a tutorial about them.
		To his surprise, I found Git Bash way easier than the destop app. 
		He said that a lot of people in his work complained about Git Bash being too hard.
		So, he thought that he will show it to me and I would decide whether it was too hard or just right.
		I don’t understand why he would be surprised it’s just easier since you only need to write about two or four words whereas in the desktop app you have to search for functions for like 20 minutes...
		</br>
		</br>
		Recently, I was surprised and very pleased to be invited to <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.paramateria.com/" ><font color = "#FF7F50">PARAMETRIA</font></a>. 
		It was an amazing experience which gave me the opportunity to see the whole process of how something that ends up in a shop is made. 
		It starts from ideas and ends at fabrication and what can be accomplished with Rhino. It was led by <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/mateuszzwierzycki"><font color = "#FF7F50">Mateusz Zwierzycki</font></a> and we were creating a Parametric Responsive Facade that would in summer block the sunlight to protect from overheating whilst in winter allow to enter the room to heat it.
		We first started with <a  target = "_blank" href= "/Content/Parametria_PrototypingPaperModel.JPG"><font color = "#FF7F50">prototyping</font></a> it on paper after that we programmed on rhino with Grasshopper components and at the end, we translated it into C# code. 
		</br>
		</br>
		In the fabrication process we laser cut the facade out of cardboard whilst the frame was made out of wood. At the end we assembled it all together.
		I was surprised to see that you could program all that in Rhino! 
		Also, I didn’t know that you would encounter so many problems in the process.
		At one point we had to improve the models and change the material since there wasn't any left.
		In addition, we wouldn't be able to bend it with the original material.
		Yet, now I know in more detail how a fabrication process looks like.
		</br>
		</br>
		Now I started to experiment with <a target = "_blank" href = "https://topologic.app/"><font color = "#FF7F50">Topologic</font></a> for a further project involving building the Chernobyl factory later on.
		At first the names of the components confused me, then I read the structure of the topologic idea. 
		Since then it was a bit easier yet still I have to get used to .byGeometry or .Geometry.
		But I like the concept of Topologic. 
		I just found a bug in Topologic whilst trying to build a cell complex, at the end I found out that it was possibly the geometry's issue and not Topologic.
		</br>
		</br>
		I had an internship at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.mcneel.com/eu/contact"><font color = "#FF7F50"> McNeel Europe S.L.</font></a> in Barcelona.
		This was the <a target = "_blank" href = "\Content\Michalin_Before_McNeel_Compound.jpeg"><font color = "#FF7F50">best internship</font></a> I ever had ![Eventhough, I must admit that it was my first one :)]
		The people in the office were very open and very welcoming, I was surprised that they were so <a target = "_blank" href = "\Content\Michalina_Programming_Python.jpeg"><font color = "#FF7F50">nice to me.</a></font>
		Also, I noticed that the office has a very strong community and everyone knew each other and helped themselves.
		I thought that I would be bringing them coffee and maybe at the end have half an hour of programming.
		That's at lest what my teacher told me I would be doing: cleaning, bringing coffee, and not programming the whole time.
		However, I was pleasantly surprised since I was only programming/building or <a target = "_blank" href= "\Content\Xavi_showing_Michalina_3dprinted_model.jpeg"><font color = "#FF7F50">3D printing.</a></font>
		It was a very eye-opening experience for me since I found out how people work as programmers in a Software Developer company.
		I decided that I would be extremely pleased to work in such a company!

		More details coming this week...

		</br>
		The Seven Sisters by Lucinda Riley
		</br>
		Lately I have been reading the <a target = "_blank" href = "/Content/SevenSisters_LucindaRiley.jpg"><font color = "#FF7F50">Seven Sisters </a> </font> series by Lucinda Riley.
		It is about six sisters who were adopted by a man they called Pa Salt.
		During their search for their biological families, they start to notice how less they now about their "father", 
		and start to wonder if he is truly away or still hiding somethin away from them, since they all agree they dont feel like he left this planet, not just yet.
		He took them all from different sides of the world, and named them after the seven sisters of the Pleiades.
		However up until now they are only 6 sisters, they are missing a sister- Merope.
		Their names are Maia- the beautiful one, Ally, Star, Cealano, Electra- the feisty one, and Merope- the missing sister.
		It is them going up in an adventure to uncover their past, from relatives or sometimes finding other ways to do so.
		The series isn't finished yet ,but I do hop it will be soon, so that I can dive in yet another juicy story of the sisters.
		</br>

		<a target = _blank href p "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37868569-we-set-the-dark-on-fire"><font color= "#FF7F50">We Set the Dark on Fire</a> </font>by Tehlor Kay Mejia
		</br>
		This is another of my favorite books. 
		It is about a society where the rich and poor are divided by a wall, the poor starving and the rich enjoying their lives.
		Also, they believe in a myth which results in the male marrying two wives: a Primera and a Segunda.
		The Primera is the wise female who isn't allowed to express emotions, she is supposed to help her husband make decisions.
		Furthermore, she has to dress plain.
		The Segunda is the opposite of the Primera, she is the one who brings the happiness into the house.
		She will be the mother and also dresses with rich colours to express her job at the house.
		It is about a girl called Dani,who goes to the Medio Shool for Girls which trains these "perfect" wives.
		She trains to become a Primera, but she needs to act as if she is from the big city since her parents secretely took her over the wall with fake papers.
		The school teaches her how to switch through different personalities, thus becoming a great actor, and great at decieving people.
		Before the ceremony, the government needs to check their papers with a new method which checks fake papers.
		Dani's only chance of survival is joining forces with La Voz, as in exchange for her part-taking for real ID papers.
		As in the Ceremony is paired with her husband, the most influential male in the World and her arch-nemesis, she joins a secret organization calles La Voz.
		La Voz wants equality so that rich or poor alike have the same possibilities and homes.
		Will she be able to survive? Will she cope with her enemy? Will she decieve everybody around her?...
		</br>

		The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov
		</br>
		This is a book about wierd things happening in Russia, because of the Devil who came with his gang.
		They are quite unique, however personally I love their jokes and personality.
		They make a lot of misshappens in the town, however providing happiness to one couple.
		The master, who writes a novel about Pontius Pilate; and his lover Margarita who loves the Master very much.
		Now, I can't tell you anymore to not spoil the book.
		However, I recommend reading this book since you will understand literature and the way he writes is extraordinary!
		It is amazing, also the jokes he puts in, if you need something to challenge you this is perfect.
		In order to read this book you need to pay attention to everything and also the vocabulary is quite advance.
