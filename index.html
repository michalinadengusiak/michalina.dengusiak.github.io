		Hello everybody! 
	  </h1>
	  
      <p style="font-family:Cormorant Garamond; font-size: 1.3em">I welcome you all old and new followers!  
	    </br> Now I decided it is time for a new adventure in the programming world.
		</br> As my next program I have chose JavaScript, because it is everywhere! 
		</br> Also I thought that it would be an exciting journey to try something totally different and new.
		</br> The course I am taking is <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/"> The Complete JavaScript Course!</a>
		</br> Up until now it was an amazing journey and I can't wait to learn the rest.
		</br> Down below is the certificate I got for the Python 3 course on <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/"> Sololearn!</a> 
		</br> It was an bumpy road to success I think that Python is an amazing program and not very hard so it was easy to learn.
		</br> I would definitely recommend as the first program to earn because it was very basic.
