		Hello everybody! 
	  </h1>
	  
      <p style="font-family:Itim; font-size: 1.3em">I welcome you all old and new followers!  
	    </br> I decided, that now I need a new challenge! So I will focus my time on Rhino and Grasshopper.
		</br> I am  now doing these two programs to see how much power they have and what I can accomplish with them...
		</br> Also I thought that it would be an exciting journey to try something totally different and new, as I still will be continuing my JavaScript course.
		</br> The course I am taking is <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/"> The Complete JavaScript Course!</a>
		</br>I think it is quite interesting to compare Python and JavaScript, to see how similar ,yet diffrent they are from each other.
		</br>Up until now it was an amazing journey and I can't wait to learn the rest.
		</br>
		</br> Down below is the certificate I got for the Python 3 course on <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/"> Sololearn!</a> 
		</br> It was an bumpy road to success but I still think that Python is an amazing program.
		</br> I would definitely recommend Python as the first program to learn since it is very easy and basic, but you can still do a lot with it.
		</br>
		</br> I am supporting the <a href = "https://www.ladybug.tools/">Ladybug Tools Spider</a> team.
		</br> I just finished the latest introduction video to the gbXML viewer "Maevia".
		</br> The below link will take you to the video. Please watch and comment :)
		</br>
		</br> I just did a violin workshop at the kindergarten with 5 year-olds.
		</br> It was an amazing  experience for me and I think they had a great time too!
		</br> I found some violins while I was upstairs taking the drums back...
		</br> I took three but two of them were broken so I just left them behind and made a violin lesson with each of the children.
